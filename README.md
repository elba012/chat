to run the code you need to run server_tcp.py (just once) first and then client_tcp.py (for each client you want). the hard-coded admins are "tal" and "amit" so they have admin option on there window.
admins can make others admin, mute and kick others. admin's nickname will start with @.
users can send message for everyone or private message, private message will start with !.
